# Code Refactor Starter Code

# Project name 
Horiseon

# General information 
website name Horiseon created by Horiseon social solution Services, inc is a functional website that had multiple <div> elements that created the page to still function but needed a clean up schematically. I went on to clean up some of the ways to make a website using HTML fundamentals, the purpose of the project was to continue off the starter code and re-write some elements to make the HTML file organized. added Nav bars, sections, article, and aside elements. restructured the footer. added ALT to images to be identified. changed the name website with Horiseon Solutions.

# project status 
project is complete


# areas of improvment 
areas to improve is CSS compiliting and getting a better understandment. better semantics into the code for other developers to read it with a better understandment. another thing is to get green check-marks on div-tools.
